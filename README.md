# sonar
Ceph Sonar is an open-source project that implements a sizing tool for Ceph configurations.

Some use models include:
- Field person in partner company wants to get a first-opinion sizing and hence pricing for a customer.
- Engineer on an IT architecture team wants to map out a Ceph configuration, based on requirements.
- an engineer wanting to learn more about specific SUSE Enterprise Storage.

This project will contain documentation to get people started. That documentation will live here, as AsciiDoc/DAPS.
